I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday

lyrics.txt:Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
lyrics.txt:I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
lyrics.txt:She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
lyrics.txt:Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
lyrics.txt:Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
lyrics.txt:Didn't make sense not to live for fun
lyrics.txt:You'll never know if you don't go
lyrics.txt:You'll never shine if you don't glow
