Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
But the meteor men beg to differ
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
Somebody better put you back into your place
