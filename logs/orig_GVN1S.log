1:Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
2:I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
3:She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
4:In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
5:Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
6:Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
7:Didn't make sense not to live for fun
8:Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
9:So much to do, so much to see
10:So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
11:You'll never know if you don't go
12:You'll never shine if you don't glow
13:Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
15:And all that glitters is gold
16:Only shooting stars break the mold
17:It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
18:You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
19:But the meteor men beg to differ
20:Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
21:The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
22:The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
23:My world's on fire, how about yours?
24:That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
